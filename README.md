# biolib-c-wasm
This repository contains a Dockerfile and a build script to assist with compilation of C and C++ to Wasm.

## Getting Started
Download `build.sh` and place it in the folder of the project you wish to compile.

You can fetch and run the docker image directly from Docker Hub. To use, run the following command:
```
docker run -v $PWD/build.sh:/build.sh -v $PWD:/input -v $PWD/output:/output biolib/c-wasm
```

The command takes in 3 volume mappings:
- `/build.sh` the build script that will be used to compile your tool to wasm
- `/input` the directory of your C/C++ project that you wish to compile
- `/output` the directory where the compiled wasm binaries should be placed

## The build.sh script

The images ships with a default build script. For simple projects, this should be sufficient. It looks like the following (see build.sh in the repository for the update-to-date version. 
Remember to change the binary name from your_binary_file_name.

```
make clean
emmake make
export BINNAME=your_binary_file_name
mv $BINNAME $BINNAME.bc
